#### Features
1. **Add Tasks**  
   Users can add tasks to their to-do list by typing in the input field and pressing the *Enter* key. The tasks are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`.

2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**  
   Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete by clicking on a circular icon.

3. **Pin and Unpin Tasks**  
   Users can prioritize tasks by pinning them to the top of the list. The pinned tasks are visually distinct with a ðŸ“Œ icon.

4. **Add Memos**  
   Each task can have a memo for additional notes or details. The memos are displayed below the task in a styled format.

5. **Delete Tasks**  
   Tasks can be removed from the list by using the delete option.

6. **Task Organization**  
   - Pinned tasks are displayed at the top, separated by a visual line.
   - Regular tasks are displayed below the pinned tasks.

7. **Local Storage Integration**  
   All tasks, their states (pinned, completed, etc.), and memos are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

8.  **Refresh Option**  
    A refresh button clears all tasks from `localStorage` and reloads the page for a fresh start.
